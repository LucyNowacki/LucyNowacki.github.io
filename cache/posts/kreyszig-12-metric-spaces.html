<p><strong>Problem 1. Show that in the metric</strong> <span class="math">\(d(x,y) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^j} \frac{|x_j - y_j|}{1 + |x_j - y_j|}\)</span> <strong>we can obtain another metric by replacing</strong> <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2^j}\)</span> <strong>by</strong> <span class="math">\(\mu_j &gt; 0\)</span> <strong>such that</strong> <span class="math">\(\sum \mu_j\)</span> <strong>converges.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<p>Given the metric:
<span class="math">\(d(x,y) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^j} \frac{|x_j - y_j|}{1 + |x_j - y_j|}\)</span></p>
<p>We want to replace <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2^j}\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\mu_j &gt; 0\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(\sum \mu_j\)</span> converges. Let's denote the new metric as <span class="math">\(d'(x,y)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(d'(x,y) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mu_j \frac{|x_j - y_j|}{1 + |x_j - y_j|}\)</span></p>
<p>To show that <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> is a metric, it must satisfy the metric axioms:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> <span class="math">\(d'(x,y) \geq 0\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(x, y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d'(x,y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
Each term in the series is non-negative due to the absolute value and the fact that <span class="math">\(\mu_j &gt; 0\)</span>. The sum is zero if and only if each term is zero, which implies <span class="math">\(x_j = y_j\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(j\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> <span class="math">\(d'(x,y) = d'(y,x)\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(x, y\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
This is evident from the absolute value in the definition of the metric.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle Inequality:</strong> <span class="math">\(d'(x,z) \leq d'(x,y) + d'(y,z)\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(x, y, z\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
For each term in the series, the triangle inequality for the absolute value gives:
<span class="math">\(\frac{|x_j - z_j|}{1 + |x_j - z_j|} \leq \frac{|x_j - y_j| + |y_j - z_j|}{1 + |x_j - y_j| + |y_j - z_j|}\)</span>
Multiplying both sides by <span class="math">\(\mu_j\)</span> and summing over all <span class="math">\(j\)</span> gives the desired result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the series <span class="math">\(\sum \mu_j\)</span> converges, the series defining <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> will also converge for any <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> (by the comparison test, since each term of the metric series is bounded by <span class="math">\(\mu_j\)</span>).</p>
<p>Thus, <span class="math">\(d'\)</span> defined with <span class="math">\(\mu_j\)</span> is a valid metric on the space as long as <span class="math">\(\sum \mu_j\)</span> converges.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2: Show that the geometric mean of two positive numbers does not exceed the arithmetic mean using the given inequality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math">\(\alpha \beta \leq \int_0^{\alpha} t^{p-1} dt + \int_0^{\beta} u^{q-1} du = \frac{\alpha^p}{p} + \frac{\beta^q}{q}\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> are positive numbers, and <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> are conjugate exponents such that <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<p>To show that the geometric mean of two positive numbers does not exceed the arithmetic mean, consider two positive numbers <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. The geometric mean is <span class="math">\(\sqrt{ab}\)</span> and the arithmetic mean is <span class="math">\(\frac{a+b}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let's set <span class="math">\(\alpha = a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta = b\)</span>, and choose <span class="math">\(p = 2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q = 2\)</span> (since they are conjugate exponents).</p>
<p>Using the given inequality:
<span class="math">\(ab \leq \frac{a^2}{2} + \frac{b^2}{2}\)</span></p>
<p>Rearranging:
<span class="math">\(2ab \leq a^2 + b^2\)</span></p>
<p>Taking the square root of both sides:
<span class="math">\(\sqrt{2ab} \leq \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\)</span></p>
<p>Dividing both sides by 2:
<span class="math">\(\sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{a+b}{2}\)</span></p>
<p>This shows that the geometric mean of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is less than or equal to their arithmetic mean.</p>
<p>Thus, the geometric mean of two positive numbers does not exceed the arithmetic mean.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 3: Show that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality implies the given inequality for sequences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math">\(\left| \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \xi_j \eta_j \right| \leq \sqrt{ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} |\xi_k|^2 } \sqrt{ \sum_{m=1}^{\infty} |\eta_m|^2 }\)</span></p>
<p><strong>To Prove:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math">\((\left| \xi_1 \right| + \dots + \left| \xi_n \right|)^2 \leq n (\left| \xi_1 \right|^2 + \dots + \left| \xi_n \right|^2)\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<p>Let's consider two sequences:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><span class="math">\(a_j = |\xi_j|\)</span> for <span class="math">\(j = 1, 2, ..., n\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(b_j = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(j\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j b_j \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j^2 \right) \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} b_j^2 \right)\)</span></p>
<p>Substituting in our choices for <span class="math">\(a_j\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_j\)</span>, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} |\xi_j| \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} |\xi_j|^2 \right) \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} 1^2 \right)\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(\sum_{j=1}^{n} 1^2 = n\)</span>, our inequality becomes:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} |\xi_j| \right)^2 \leq n \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} |\xi_j|^2 \right)\)</span></p>
<p>This completes the proof.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 4: Find a sequence that converges to 0 but is not in any :math:`l^p` space, where :math:`1 leq p &lt; +infty`.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Given:</strong></p>
<p>Consider the sequence <span class="math">\((x_n)\)</span> defined as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x_n =
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{k} &amp; \text{if } n = 2^k \text{ for some } k \in \mathbb{N} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This means that the sequence <span class="math">\((x_n)\)</span> will have the values:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x_1 = 0, x_2 = 1, x_3 = 0, x_4 = \frac{1}{2}, x_5 = x_6 = x_7 = 0, x_8 = \frac{1}{3}, \dots
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Convergence to 0:</strong>
Clearly, <span class="math">\((x_n)\)</span> converges to 0 as <span class="math">\(n\)</span> approaches infinity because the sequence is 0 at all but countably many points, and where it is not 0, it is a sequence of numbers <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{k}\)</span> which tends to 0 as <span class="math">\(k\)</span> increases.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Not in any</strong> <span class="math">\(l^p\)</span> <strong>space:</strong>
To see why <span class="math">\((x_n)\)</span> is not in any <span class="math">\(l^p\)</span> space, consider the <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-norm of <span class="math">\((x_n)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
||x_n||_p = \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n|^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For <span class="math">\(n = 2^k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x_n = \frac{1}{k}\)</span>. So, the <span class="math">\(p\)</span>-norm becomes:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
||x_n||_p = \left( \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{k} \right)^p \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Given that the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{k} \right)^p\)</span> is divergent for <span class="math">\(p \leq 1\)</span>, it implies that the sequence <span class="math">\((x_n)\)</span> is not in any <span class="math">\(l^p\)</span> space for <span class="math">\(p \leq 1\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Consider the sequence <span class="math">\(x_n\)</span> defined by:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x_n = \frac{1}{n^{\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(l^p\)</span> for <span class="math">\(p &gt; 1\)</span>:</p>
<p>For the sequence to be in <span class="math">\(l^p\)</span>, the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n|^p\)</span> must converge. In this case:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{1}{n^{\alpha}} \right)^p = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{p\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Given that <span class="math">\(p &gt; 1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)</span>, the exponent <span class="math">\(p\alpha\)</span> will be strictly between 1 and <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Since the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}\)</span> converges for <span class="math">\(s &gt; 1\)</span>, our series will converge for any <span class="math">\(p &gt; 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof: Convergence of the series</strong> <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}\)</span> <strong>for</strong> <span class="math">\(s &gt; 1\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Integral Test:</strong></p>
<p>To determine the convergence of the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}\)</span>, we can compare it to the improper integral:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}

</div>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Evaluate the integral:</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^s} \, dx = \lim_{{b \to \infty}} \int_{1}^{b} x^{-s} \, dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Using the power rule for integration:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{{b \to \infty}} \left[ \frac{x^{-s+1}}{-s+1} \right]_1^b = \lim_{{b \to \infty}} \left[ \frac{1}{(1-s)b^{s-1}} - \frac{1}{1-s} \right]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For <span class="math">\(s &gt; 1\)</span>, the term <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{(1-s)b^{s-1}}\)</span> approaches 0 as <span class="math">\(b\)</span> approaches infinity. Thus, the integral converges to:</p>

\frac{1}{s-1}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p><strong>Comparison with the series:</strong></p></li>

<p>Since the improper integral converges, the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}\)</span> also converges by the integral test.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}\)</span> converges for all <span class="math">\(s &gt; 1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is not in <span class="math">\(l^1\)</span>:</p>
<p>For the sequence to be in <span class="math">\(l^1\)</span>, the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} |x_n|\)</span> must converge. In this case:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{\alpha}}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Given that <span class="math">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)</span>, this is a p-series with <span class="math">\(p = \alpha\)</span>, and it is known that such a series diverges when <span class="math">\(p \leq 1\)</span>. Thus, the sequence <span class="math">\(x_n\)</span> is not in <span class="math">\(l^1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof: Divergence of the series</strong> <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}\)</span> <strong>for</strong> <span class="math">\(p \leq 1\)</span></p>
<p><strong>Integral Test:</strong></p>
<p>To determine the convergence of the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}\)</span>, we can compare it to the improper integral:</p>

\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Using the power rule for integration:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>For <span class="math">\(p \leq 1\)</span>, the term <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{(1-p)b^{p-1}}\)</span> does not approach 0 as <span class="math">\(b\)</span> approaches infinity. Instead, it either remains constant (for (p = 1)) or grows without bound (for (p &lt; 1)). Thus, the integral diverges.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p><strong>Comparison with the series:</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Since the improper integral diverges, the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}\)</span> also diverges by the integral test.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the series <span class="math">\(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^p}\)</span> diverges for all <span class="math">\(p \leq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the sequence <span class="math">\(x_n = \frac{1}{n^{\alpha}}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(l^p\)</span> for any <span class="math">\(p &gt; 1\)</span> but is not in <span class="math">\(l^1\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Given:</strong>
The diameter <span class="math">\(\delta(A)\)</span> of a nonempty set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> in a metric space <span class="math">\((X,d)\)</span> is defined as:</p>

<p>A set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is said to be bounded if <span class="math">\(\delta(A) &lt; \infty\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Intuition:</strong>
Consider two nested sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> in a metric space. The inner set represents <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and the outer set represents <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p>

<p>The maximum distance between any two points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> will always be less than or equal to the maximum distance between any two points in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. This is because every point in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is also in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, and the supremum of distances in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> must account for all distances in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> as well as additional distances between points exclusive to <span class="math">\(B\)</span> or between points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and points exclusive to <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
1. Let's consider any two points <span class="math">\(x, y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(A \subset B\)</span>, both <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are also in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. Therefore, the distance <span class="math">\(d(x, y)\)</span> is also a distance between two points in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.
2. Given the definition of <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> as the supremum of distances between any two points in a set, the maximum distance between any two points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> will always be less than or equal to the maximum distance between any two points in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. This is because the set of all distances in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of the set of all distances in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.
3. Therefore, <span class="math">\(\delta(A) \leq \delta(B)\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 7:</strong>
Given the definition of the diameter <span class="math">\(\delta(A)\)</span> of a nonempty set <span class="math">\(A\)</span> in a metric space <span class="math">\((X,d)\)</span>, show that:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\delta(A) = \sup_{x, y \in A} d(x, y)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Show that <span class="math">\(\delta(A) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> consists of a single point.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<p><strong>(=&gt;) Direction:</strong>
Assume <span class="math">\(\delta(A) = 0\)</span>. This means that the supremum of the distances between all pairs of points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is 0. For any two distinct points <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, the distance <span class="math">\(d(x, y)\)</span> must be 0. However, in a metric space, the distance between two distinct points is always greater than 0. Therefore, the only way for the supremum of the distances to be 0 is if there are no pairs of distinct points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. This implies that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> consists of a single point.</p>
<p><strong>(&lt;=) Direction:</strong>
Assume <span class="math">\(A\)</span> consists of a single point, say <span class="math">\(a\)</span>. Then, for any <span class="math">\(x, y \in A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(x = y = a\)</span>. The distance <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(a, a) = 0\)</span>. Since this is the only possible distance between points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, the supremum of these distances is also 0. Therefore, <span class="math">\(\delta(A) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Combining both directions, we conclude that <span class="math">\(\delta(A) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(A\)</span> consists of a single point.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
To show that <span class="math">\(D\)</span> does not define a metric on the power set of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, we need to show that at least one of the metric properties is violated by <span class="math">\(D\)</span>. The metric properties are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> For all sets <span class="math">\(A, B\)</span> in the power set of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(D(A,B) \geq 0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Identity of indiscernibles:</strong> <span class="math">\(D(A,B) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(A = B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> For all sets <span class="math">\(A, B\)</span> in the power set of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(D(A,B) = D(B,A)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle inequality:</strong> For all sets <span class="math">\(A, B, C\)</span> in the power set of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(D(A,C) \leq D(A,B) + D(B,C)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will focus on the second property, the identity of indiscernibles.</p>
<p>Consider two distinct sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> contains one additional point <span class="math">\(b\)</span> not in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Now, for any point <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, the distance <span class="math">\(d(a, b)\)</span> is some positive value. However, since <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, the distance between any point in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and itself in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is 0. This means that the infimum of the distances between points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is 0, even though <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are distinct sets. This violates the identity of indiscernibles property, as <span class="math">\(D(A,B) = 0\)</span> even when <span class="math">\(A \neq B\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof with Visualization:</strong></p>
<p>Consider two distinct sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> in a metric space such that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a proper subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. As visualized, <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is represented by the inner circle, and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is represented by the outer circle. The point <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is in both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, while the point <span class="math">\(b\)</span> is only in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the distance <span class="math">\(d(a, b)\)</span> between any point <span class="math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and the point <span class="math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is some positive value. However, since <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subset of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, the distance between any point in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and itself in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is 0. This means that the infimum of the distances between points in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is 0, even though <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are distinct sets. This violates the identity of indiscernibles property, as <span class="math">\(D(A,B) = 0\)</span> even when <span class="math">\(A \neq B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math">\(D\)</span> does not define a metric on the power set of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p>

<p>This statement is true.

This implies that there exists a pair of points <span class="math">\(a \in A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b \in B\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(d(a, b) = 0\)</span>. In a metric space, the distance between two points is 0 if and only if the two points are the same. Therefore, <span class="math">\(a = b\)</span>, which means there exists a point that belongs to both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math">\(A \cap B \neq \emptyset\)</span>.</p>

<p>In the above visualization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The circle represents the set <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The points labeled &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are two arbitrary points in <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p></li>

<p>From the triangle inequality, the direct distance between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (i.e., <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span>) is always less than or equal to the sum of their distances to any point &quot;b&quot; in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.

<img alt="Visualization of the union of two bounded sets" src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/55851edd-7940-4ce1-b5b4-c96a59787567" />
<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>
<p>Let's assume that both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are bounded sets. This means:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\delta(A) = \sup_{x,y \in A} d(x, y) &lt; \infty
\delta(B) = \sup_{x,y \in B} d(x, y) &lt; \infty
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, consider any two points <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A \cup B\)</span>. There are three possible scenarios:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Both <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> are in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Both <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> are in <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(p\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(B\)</span> or vice versa.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the first scenario, <span class="math">\(d(p, q) \leq \delta(A)\)</span> since <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is bounded.</p>
<p>For the second scenario, <span class="math">\(d(p, q) \leq \delta(B)\)</span> since <span class="math">\(B\)</span> is bounded.</p>
<p>For the third scenario, let's use the triangle inequality:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(p, q) \leq d(p, r) + d(r, q)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Where <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is any point in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> (or <span class="math">\(B\)</span>). Since both <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are bounded, we can say:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(p, q) \leq \delta(A) + \delta(B)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Combining all three scenarios, the supremum of the distances between any two points in <span class="math">\(A \cup B\)</span> is:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\delta(A \cup B) \leq \max(\delta(A), \delta(B), \delta(A) + \delta(B))
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since both <span class="math">\(\delta(A)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\delta(B)\)</span> are finite, their sum is also finite. Thus, <span class="math">\(\delta(A \cup B) &lt; \infty\)</span>, which means <span class="math">\(A \cup B\)</span> is bounded.</p>
<p>This completes the proof.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 11:</strong></p>
<p>Given a metric space <span class="math">\((X,d)\)</span>, another metric on <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is defined by:</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> For any <span class="math">\(x, y \in X\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
\tilde{d}(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)} = \frac{d(y,x)}{1+d(y,x)} = \tilde{d}(y,x)

<p>Using the properties of fractions and the triangle inequality for <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, we can show that:</p>

\begin{equation*}
\tilde{d}(x,z) + \tilde{d}(z,y) \geq \tilde{d}(x,y)

</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Part 2: Show that (X) is bounded in the metric (tilde{d}(x,y)):</strong></p>
<p>Given the nature of the fraction, as <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> increases, the value of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> also increases, but at a diminishing rate due to the increasing denominator. As <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> approaches infinity, <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> approaches but never exceeds 1. This means that for all pairs <span class="math">\(x, y \in X\)</span>, the value of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> is always between 0 and 1, inclusive. Therefore, the supremum of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> over all <span class="math">\(x, y \in X\)</span> is 1, which means that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> is bounded in the metric <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> with diameter at most 1.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation for the supremum statement:</strong></p>
<p>The function <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}\)</span> is a fraction where the numerator is the original distance between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and the denominator is 1 plus that distance. The smallest value of <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> is 0 (when <span class="math">\(x=y\)</span>), and in this case, <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y) = 0\)</span>. As <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> increases, the value of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> also increases, but at a diminishing rate due to the increasing denominator. As <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> approaches infinity, <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> approaches but never exceeds 1. This means that the largest possible value of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> over all <span class="math">\(x, y \in X\)</span> is 1.</p>
<p>This completes the proof.</p>
<p>Let's delve deeper into the statement &quot;the supremum of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> over all <span class="math">\(x,y \in X\)</span> is at most 1.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<p>The function <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y) = \frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}\)</span> is a fraction where the numerator is the original distance between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, and the denominator is 1 plus that distance.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The smallest value of <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> is 0 (when <span class="math">\(x=y\)</span>), and in this case, <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y) = 0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>As <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> increases, the value of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> also increases. However, because of the denominator <span class="math">\(1+d(x,y)\)</span>, the rate of increase of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> is slower than the rate of increase of <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>As <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> approaches infinity, the fraction <span class="math">\(\frac{d(x,y)}{1+d(x,y)}\)</span> approaches 1. This means that no matter how large <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> becomes, <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> will never exceed 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, the largest possible value of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> over all <span class="math">\(x,y \in X\)</span> is 1, making the supremum of <span class="math">\(\tilde{d}(x,y)\)</span> equal to 1.</p>
