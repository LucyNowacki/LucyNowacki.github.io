<p><strong>Problem 1. Show that the real line is a metric space.</strong></p>
<p>To demonstrate that the real line is a metric space, we must define a distance function (or metric) on the real line and confirm that it adheres to the properties of a metric.</p>
<p>Let's represent the real line as <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and consider two points <span class="math">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of the Metric (Distance Function):</strong></p>
<p>Define the distance between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> as:
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = |x - y|\)</span>
where <span class="math">\(| \cdot |\)</span> symbolizes the absolute value.</p>
<p>We now need to confirm that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> adheres to the three properties of a metric:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = |x - y| \geq 0\)</span> because the absolute value is always non-negative.
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x - y = 0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = |x - y| = |- (y - x)| = |y - x| = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle Inequality:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
Using the properties of absolute values, we have:
<span class="math">\(|x - z| = |(x - y) + (y - z)| \leq |x - y| + |y - z|\)</span>.
Thus, <span class="math">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the distance function <span class="math">\(d\)</span> adheres to all three properties of a metric on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, we can deduce that the real line <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is a metric space with metric <span class="math">\(d\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 2. Does</strong> <span class="math">\(d(x,y) = (x-y)^2\)</span> <strong>define a metric on the set of all real numbers?</strong></p>
<p>To determine if <span class="math">\(d(x,y) = (x-y)^2\)</span> defines a metric on the set of all real numbers, we need to check if it satisfies the three properties of a metric:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = (x-y)^2\)</span> is always non-negative since the square of any real number is non-negative.
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\((x-y)^2 = 0\)</span>, which implies <span class="math">\(x-y = 0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = (x-y)^2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d(y, x) = (y-x)^2\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\((x-y)^2 = (y-x)^2\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle Inequality:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
We need to check if <span class="math">\((x-z)^2 \leq (x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>.
This inequality does not hold in general. For a counterexample, consider <span class="math">\(x = 0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y = 1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(z = 2\)</span>. We have:
<span class="math">\((x-z)^2 = 4\)</span>
<span class="math">\((x-y)^2 + (y-z)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2\)</span>
Clearly, 4 is not less than or equal to 2, so the triangle inequality is not satisfied.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the triangle inequality is not satisfied for the function <span class="math">\(d(x,y) = (x-y)^2\)</span>, we can conclude that it does not define a metric on the set of all real numbers.</p>

<p>Define the distance between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> as:
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = \sqrt{|x - y|}\)</span>
where <span class="math">\(| \cdot |\)</span> symbolizes the absolute value.</p>
<p>We now need to confirm that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> adheres to the three properties of a metric:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) \geq 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = \sqrt{|x - y|}\)</span> is always non-negative since the square root of any non-negative number is non-negative.
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(\sqrt{|x-y|} = 0\)</span>, which implies <span class="math">\(|x-y| = 0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
<span class="math">\(d(x, y) = \sqrt{|x - y|}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d(y, x) = \sqrt{|y - x|}\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(|x-y| = |y-x|\)</span>, we have <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle Inequality:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</span>.</p>

We need to check if <span class="math">\(\sqrt{|x-z|} \leq \sqrt{|x-y|} + \sqrt{|y-z|}\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>.
Squaring both sides, this is equivalent to checking if <span class="math">\(|x-z| \leq |x-y| + 2\sqrt{|x-y|}\sqrt{|y-z|} + |y-z|\)</span>.
Using the triangle inequality for absolute values, we have:
<span class="math">\(|x-z| \leq |x-y| + |y-z|\)</span>.
Since <span class="math">\(2\sqrt{|x-y|}\sqrt{|y-z|}\)</span> is always non-negative, the inequality <span class="math">\(|x-z| \leq |x-y| + 2\sqrt{|x-y|}\sqrt{|y-z|} + |y-z|\)</span> is satisfied.</p>
</li>

<p>Given that the distance function <span class="math">\(d\)</span> adheres to all three properties of a metric on <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, we can deduce that the real line <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> is a metric space with metric <span class="math">\(d\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 4. Find all metrics on set X consisting of two points. Consiting of one point.</strong></p>
<p>Consider a set <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with two distinct points, <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math">\(d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> to be a metric, it must satisfy the following properties:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><span class="math">\(d(x, y) \geq 0\)</span> (non-negativity)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span> (identity of indiscernibles)</p></li>

<li><p><span class="math">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</span> (triangle inequality)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Given that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> has only two points, the possible distances are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><span class="math">\(d(a, a) = 0\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(d(b, b) = 0\)</span></p></li>

<li><p><span class="math">\(d(b, a) = d(a, b)\)</span></p></li>

<p>Thus, for any positive real number <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, defining <span class="math">\(d(a, b) = r\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d(b, a) = r\)</span> gives a metric on <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.

<p>Consider the space <span class="math">\(l^{\infty}\)</span>, which consists of all bounded sequences. If <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subspace of <span class="math">\(l^{\infty}\)</span> consisting of all sequences of zeros and ones, then the metric of <span class="math">\(l^{\infty}\)</span> induces a metric on <span class="math">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>For <span class="math">\(d: A \times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> to be a metric, it must satisfy the following properties:</p>

<p><strong>Definition of the Induced Metric:</strong></p>
<p>For any two sequences <span class="math">\(x, y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, the distance between them in the induced metric is given by:
<span class="math">\(d(x,y) = \sup_{j \in \mathbb{N}} |x_j - y_j|\)</span></p>
<p>However, since each <span class="math">\(x_j\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y_j\)</span> can only be 0 or 1 in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> The absolute difference <span class="math">\(|x_j - y_j|\)</span> can only be 0 (if <span class="math">\(x_j = y_j\)</span>) or 1 (if <span class="math">\(x_j \neq y_j\)</span>). Therefore, the supremum will be 0 if the sequences are the same and 1 if they are different at any position.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
The absolute difference between any two terms of sequences in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is either 0 or 1. The supremum of a set of non-negative numbers that includes 0 and does not exceed 1 is 1.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> For all sequences <span class="math">\(x, y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
The order of the terms in the absolute difference does not affect its value, so <span class="math">\(|x_j - y_j| = |y_j - x_j|\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle Inequality:</strong> This needs to be verified for the induced metric on <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Given the nature of sequences in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, the triangle inequality holds.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
For any three sequences <span class="math">\(x, y, z\)</span> in <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, the triangle inequality can be verified by considering the individual terms of the sequences and noting that the sum of the absolute differences for any term does not exceed 1.</p>

<p><strong>In other words, the induced metric on</strong> <span class="math">\(A\)</span> <strong>is:</strong>
<span class="math">\(d(x,y) = \begin{cases}
0 &amp; \text{if } x=y \\
1 &amp; \text{if } x \neq y

<p>This is known as the discrete metric. Every pair of distinct sequences in <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is at a distance of 1 from each other, while the distance between a sequence and itself is 0.</p>
<p>Given the properties and proofs outlined above, the induced metric on <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is indeed a metric.</p>

<p><strong>Verification of Metric Properties:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">

<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> The absolute value function is symmetric, so swapping <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> does not change the value of the integrand.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>

<p>For any two ordered triples <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> in <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, the metric <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> is defined as the number of positions at which the entries of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> differ.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Let's consider two ordered triples:
<span class="math">\(x = (0,1,0)\)</span>
<span class="math">\(y = (1,1,1)\)</span></p>
<p>Comparing the entries of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> position by position:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At the first position: <span class="math">\(x\)</span> has 0 and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> has 1. They are different.</p></li>
<li><p>At the second position: Both <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> have 1. They are the same.</p></li>
<li><p>At the third position: <span class="math">\(x\)</span> has 0 and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> has 1. They are different.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, there are 2 positions at which <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> have different entries. Therefore, <span class="math">\(d(x,y) = 2\)</span>.</p>
<p>In essence, the metric <span class="math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> for the set <span class="math">\(X\)</span> counts the number of &quot;mismatches&quot; between the entries of two ordered triples. The more mismatches there are, the &quot;farther apart&quot; the two ordered triples are considered to be in terms of the metric.</p>
<p>This format should be suitable for Nikola reStructuredText (rst) rendering.</p>
<p>Properties of the Metric d:</p>
<p>To show that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> is a metric, we need to verify the following properties:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Non-negativity:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) \geq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
The number of differing positions between two ordered triples is always non-negative.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Identity of Indiscernibles:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
If <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = 0\)</span>, it means there are no differing positions between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>, implying <span class="math">\(x = y\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetry:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y \in X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, y) = d(y, x)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
The number of differing positions between <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> is the same as the number of differing positions between <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Triangle Inequality:</strong> For all <span class="math">\(x, y, z \in X\)</span>, <span class="math">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Proof:</em>
Let's consider three ordered triples <span class="math">\(x, y,\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z\)</span> from set <span class="math">\(X\)</span>. For each position in the ordered triples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z\)</span> have the same entry, then the contribution to <span class="math">\(d(x, z)\)</span> is 0 for that position.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z\)</span> have different entries, then either <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> have different entries, or <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z\)</span> have different entries, or both. This means that the sum of the contributions to <span class="math">\(d(x, y)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d(y, z)\)</span> for that position is at least 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Summing over all positions, we get:
<span class="math">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</span></p>
<p>Thus, the triangle inequality is satisfied for the Hamming distance on set <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that the metric <span class="math">\(d\)</span> satisfies all the properties of a metric on <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, we can conclude that <span class="math">\(d\)</span> defines a metric on the set <span class="math">\(X\)</span> of all ordered triples of zeros and ones.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 11. Prove</strong></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x_1, x_{k+1}) \leq (d(x_1,x_2) + d(x_2,x_3) + \ldots + d(x_{k-1}, x_k)) + d(x_k, x_{k+1})
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Given a metric space with metric <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, we want to prove that for any sequence of points <span class="math">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\)</span> in the space:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x_1, x_n) \leq d(x_1,x_2) + d(x_2,x_3) + \ldots + d(x_{n-1}, x_n)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>To prove this, we'll use induction on <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Base Case</strong>  <span class="math">\(n=2\)</span> For <span class="math">\(n = 2\)</span> , the statement is trivially true as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x_1, x_2) \leq d(x_1, x_2)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p><strong>Inductive Step</strong>
Assuming our inductive hypothesis, we have:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x_1, x_k) \leq d(x_1,x_2) + d(x_2,x_3) + \ldots + d(x_{k-1}, x_k)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Now, consider the distance between <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_{k+1}\)</span>. Using the triangle inequality, we can say:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x_1, x_{k+1}) \leq d(x_1, x_k) + d(x_k, x_{k+1})
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math">\(d(x_1, x_{k+1})\)</span> is the total distance from <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_{k+1}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(d(x_1, x_k)\)</span> represents the distance from <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_k\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math">\(d(x_k, x_{k+1})\)</span> is the distance between the points <span class="math">\(x_k\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_{k+1}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The triangle inequality tells us that the direct path from <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_{k+1}\)</span> is shorter than or equal to the sum of the path from <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_k\)</span> and then from <span class="math">\(x_k\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_{k+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, using our inductive assumption, we can replace <span class="math">\(d(x_1, x_k)\)</span> with the sum of distances between consecutive points up to <span class="math">\(x_k\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x_1, x_{k+1}) \leq (d(x_1,x_2) + d(x_2,x_3) + \ldots + d(x_{k-1}, x_k)) + d(x_k, x_{k+1})
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>This equation essentially states that the direct distance from <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(x_{k+1}\)</span> is less than or equal to the sum of distances when traveling through all intermediate points up to <span class="math">\(x_{k+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, our inductive step is complete, and the statement holds for <span class="math">\(n = k+1\)</span>.</p>
<p>By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The given inequality is a direct consequence of the triangle inequality, and it holds for any sequence of points in a metric space.</p>
<p><strong>Problem 12.</strong></p>
<p>Given the inequality:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x_1, x_{k+1}) \leq (d(x_1,x_2) + d(x_2,x_3) + \ldots + d(x_{k-1}, x_k)) + d(x_k, x_{k+1})
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We aim to prove:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
|d(x,y) - d(z,w)| \leq d(x,z) + d(y,w)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p><strong>Proof</strong></p>
<p>Using the triangle inequality, we have:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Similarly:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(z,w) \leq d(z,y) + d(y,w)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>From the first inequality, expressing d(z,y) :</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(z,y) \geq d(x,y) - d(x,z)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Substituting into the second inequality:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(z,w) \leq d(x,y) - d(x,z) + d(y,w)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Rearranging, we get:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x,y) - d(z,w) \leq d(x,z) + d(y,w)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Similarly, by interchanging  x and  z and y  and  w , we derive:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(z,w) - d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(y,w)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Combining the two results:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
|d(x,y) - d(z,w)| \leq d(x,z) + d(y,w)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>In conclusion, the direct path (straight line) between any two points is always shorter than or equal to the sum of the paths that go through an intermediate point.</p>
<p>This completes the proof.</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p><strong>Using the Triangle Inequality:</strong></p>
<p>We know from the triangle inequality that:
<span class="math">\(d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)\)</span>
(1)</p>
<p>Similarly, we have:

<p><strong>Problem 16.</strong></p>
<p>We aim to prove the following inequality using the triangle inequality:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x,y) \leq d(z,x) + d(z,y)

<p>Using the triangle inequality for any three points x ,  y , and  z  in a metric space, we have:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)

<p><strong>A bit detailed look</strong></p>
<p>The triangle inequality states that for any three points in a metric space, the direct distance between two of them is always less than or equal to the sum of their distances to the third point.</p>
